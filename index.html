						Welcome to the Interactive Fiction game, Defeat the Glabgargs. This site is a github pages site that walks through the process of creating this game, while also allowing access 
						for playing the game in general. Throughout this journey, there are multiple versions of thei game that shows you how to create a text adventure and an interactive fiction through 
						multiple types or processes. This even goes through the history of creating two of these versions of the program and also designing a simple game. You will be provided with explanations, 
						examples, walk-throughs, and the history behind the versions as well. All of this will hopefully help you if you're interested in making a text-adventure. These different sections are there 
						to help people new to programming, new to game development, and those that want to learn different development environments. Hope you enjoy what you see.
				</p>
				<p>All main sections are accessible via the navigation bar. When new articles are posted, there will be updated information in the section articles on this page that will have the direct links to those articles.</p>

					<h3>Designing Game Article</h3>

					<h3>Python Version Article</h3>
					<p>The latest update for this particular portion includes updating the link to the repository and the main page. This contains an introduction and a list of what you will need in order 
						to learn the basics using python as I did. To that end, you can also go into the repository and find a build of the simpler, python, version of the game to play and see how the game 
						works.

					<h3>Inky Version Article</h3>
					<p>The main page has an introduction and a list of resources at this time. The game in this version is in development.</p>
					<p class="importantNotice">Note: There is a hyperlink tag in the aside, but it currently leads nowhere. This is set up for the future when the development is ready for deploying to the repository.</p>

					<h3>C# Version Article</h3>
					<p>The main page has an introduction, the list of tools you will need, and an updated link to the repository. As with the python version of the game, you can review the code, but there is also a playable version of this 
						game to let you see how everything works. The main point of this section is to show you how C# works and working from scratch as opposed to using an environment like Inky or Godot to help you in the development.
