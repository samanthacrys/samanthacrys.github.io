					<p>
						Welcome to the C# version of <em>Defeat the Glabgargs</em>. This is version is for those that are more into building a more interactive fiction game from the ground up. 
						If you have gone through the previous areas of this site, you will see how the game has been built up using tools that can help such as Inky and Godot. In the case of this 
						version of the game, you do not have a game development engine to help you. You are instead left to do all the programming on your own without any sort of environement to 
						back you up. I hope you're ready for this.

					<h3>What You Will Need</h3>

					<p>In terms of what you are going to need, you will mainly need Visual Studio Community Edition on the lowest end. Alternatively, you can get JetBrains Rider as well. You just 
						need to make sure that the C# library is installed on both of these. Below are the links for these downloads.
