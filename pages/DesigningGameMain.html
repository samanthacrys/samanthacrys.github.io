						When you're new to game designing, you can often feel overwhelmed knowing what to do. You can spend a lot of time researching and looking at what people do, but not necessarily 
						understand what you are doing or why you should do something the way people are saying. This area of the site is to help you learn and understand how designing works without 
						all the difficulty or falling into pitfalls that those new to programming can.

					<p>The first article of this section has been published. You can visit the navigation bar, or click this title: <a href="BasicDesigning/AskingQuestions.html">First Questions You Need to Ask</a>.</p>

					<h3>What You Need</h3>

					<p>The basics that you need are a pencil/pen and paper.</p>
					<p>
						For those that want to do all of their designing on the computer, you will need a Text program and a paint program at a minimum. This means you can use notepad and paint on the PC. 
						If you are using Linux or MacOS, you can use the built in text editor program found there if you do not have a program like Word. For a basic art program on Linux and MacOS, you will need to find 
						something. I use Krita and highly recommend it. You just want something that can do boxes and arrows when doing a text-adventure. If you are someone that is looking specifically for a flowchart program, you 
						can use multiple programs such as Visio, Flowchart Designer, LucidChart, and Draw.io. Below are the links to all of these products.
					</p>

					<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-office">Office 365</a>, this can include Visio as well, but this is not free and may not work well for you.</p>
					<p><a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a></p>
					<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flowchart-designer-3/id1512570906">Flowchart Designer 3</a>, this is the version I use. There are newer versions and it can be purchased through the MacOS App Store.</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/flowchart-maker">LucidChart</a></p>
					<p><a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">Draw.io</a></p>

				<h3>Have Fun</h3>
				<p>
					Since you're unlikely to find a github set up for the design process, what with all the images being available here, I want to just encourage you to have fun and let yourself 
					be free. You're in the designing phase and, while you may find out you may be unable to do something for whatever reason, the fact is that you need to put it down so you know 
					what you're thinking of.
