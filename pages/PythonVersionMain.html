						Welcome to the original Python version of <em>Defeat the Glabgargs</em>. This version is the most basic. For those that are new to programming and want to learn different aspects and 
						how a game is built, this is a beginner source. The idea is that this will help you in better understanding the basics of programming before you get into more complicated ideas like classes and 
						databases. You are facing a simple product that you can replicate with your own game idea as well. For those that are attending SNHU's IT-140 class through their online CS program, that is where this 
						version came from. You'll learn more about it in the history section, but hopefully this is a resource that can help you understand what you're being asked to do.

					<h3>History of How this Version Came About</h3>
					<p>The original version of Defeat the Glabgargs, which is the Python version, came about because of a class assignment. During my time at SNHU, I had to take an introduction to scripting class. Now, before this, I had taken an introduction to programming class, but I had to retake one at SNHU. This class taught the basics of programming and had you working on a single project all term. This project was a text-adventure.</p>
					<p>As a part of this, we had to learn a lot about designing games, following instruction requirements like you would if you were handling a client's requirements, and implement what we were learning. When I created this game, I had intended it to be more involved than it ended up being. This was because the class went for simple and more straight-forward than I was used to. I had worked in some game development before and was used to the story-writing. That wasn't a part of the assignment and there wasn't much in the way of being able to include that. It meant that I had to learn to be less detailed than I was used to. That led to the iteration that makes up this python version. Without certain pieces of information, the game didn't come out fully as expected, but it did what was needed in terms of the assignment. I kept that in mind to create a better version later. This ended up being the C# version.</p>

					<h3>What You Will Need</h3>

					<p>
						There are mainly two pieces that you will need. You will need to install python and Pycharm. Pycharm is what was used to develop this game originally. Additionally, the resources provided 
						on the python website will be useful as well when programming.
