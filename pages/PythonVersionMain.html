						Welcome to the original Python version of <em>Defeat the Glabgargs</em>. This version is the most basic. For those that are new to programming and want to learn different aspects and 
						how a game is built, this is a beginner source. The idea is that this will help you in better understanding the basics of programming before you get into more complicated ideas like classes and 
						databases. You are facing a simple product that you can replicate with your own game idea as well. For those that are attending SNHU's IT-140 class through their online CS program, that is where this 
						version came from. You'll learn more about it in the history section, but hopefully this is a resource that can help you understand what you're being asked to do.
