					<h3>First Questions You Need to Ask</h3>
                    <p>Designing a game can take many forms, but that doesn’t stop that there are two main questions that you should ask yourself.  The first question you should always ask is:</p>
                    <p><em><strong>What kind of game am I’m making?</strong></em></p>
                    <p>The reason that this is important is that you cannot ask yourself any other questions until you know if you’re making an interactive fiction, a text-adventure, a casual game, and the like. Now, I know that may want to say, “I already know that”, but you have to be certain that you do. Just knowing that you have a game idea doesn’t always mean you know what kind of game it is. Sometimes you find out that your idea may work better as a different type of game and that can leave you feeling discouraged if you started in one direction only to have to change gears.</p>
                    <p>To better explain this, I can give an example from my own experience. I have three different types of games that I am working on. One is a pen and paper RPG, one is an interactive fiction, and the other is an undetermined type. Now, the first two, I can say for certain what I’m doing and asking myself the question of what kind of game I’m making has been done. The third one I don’t know. It’s currently a toss-up between another pen and paper RPG or a video game RPG. Now, what’s the difference? How you design them is different. The video game route requires certain techniques and tools that I don’t have with the pen and paper. It also means that the players interact and expect different results. This is why you ask yourself the question, even if you’re certain. To answer this question helps you in understanding what you need and the direction you’ll have to go or the research you’ll need to do.</p>
                    <p>From there, you have to ask yourself, <em><strong>what is the goal of your game?</strong></em></p>
                    <p>This is important because you need to know what you’re wanting out of the game. RPGs are very different from casual games. You have different goals. Do you want your game to have a story that the player goes through and becomes the champion in the end? Do you want it to be a way to reduce the player’s stress? These are things you have to ask yourself because, without that, your game design may go in ways you don’t expect or stall out. The clearer your idea, the easier it will be to design your game.</p>
                    <p>With my earlier example of the undetermined game, if I went in the pen and paper route, for instance, I would know that the goal is for a group of people to get together with one person as the game master and they have an adventure where they can spend hours or weeks just playing through a story that lets them build up to another story later. If I went the video game RPG route, then it’s the player playing through a pre-determined story to reach the end goal of being the hero. That is the goal of the game.</p>
                    <p>In the end, with these two questions, you have the beginnings of what you need to ask yourself. It may seem simple and like there’s no way it’s that small, but it’s a lot. You’ll still have questions you need to ask, but those are more when you finally begin the nitty-gritty parts of designing the game. These first two questions will help you immensely and begin to give you an idea of what you’re doing. </p>
                    <p>For how this relates to Defeat the Glabgargs, these were questions I had to ask, even though it was a school assignment. I had to know what my goal was and what kind of game it was. Now, the class answered that, but I had to ask to ensure I understood what I was doing so I could complete the assignment to the best of my ability. While most of this site is focused around recreating Defeat the Glabgargs in different formats and how those styles work, I want you to be able to go forward and create your own games from what I’m showing you here, instead of just recreating what I already did.</p>

				<h3>You Can Do It!</h3>
                <p>While it may feel like you  end up overwhelmed in trying to answer these two questions or that you'll never make it, it's important to understand that you can do it. Everyone starts off somewhere and you just need to keep at it. Once you learn to do this, it does become easier.</p>
