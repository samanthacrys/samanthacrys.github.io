						Welcome to the Godot version of <em>Defeat the Glabgargs</em>. This is sort of the third step that you can get. While you may think that Inky should be first or that it should be second 
						you have to understand that Inky and Python are each teaching you something different. This version actually shows you working with a game development engine. Godot is a standard system that 
						many have used to create games. With the open-soure formatting of Godot, you are able to make changes and update in a way that can help you.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, I'm sure someone may ask, but why is this the third slot on the navigation bar and the main page. The reason this is is because you're now taking what you saw in Inky and working on it yourself. 
						You are now facing the fact that you're back to coding, but you're doing something more complex than the simple python version, but now you're bringing in the aspects that you learned through the program 
						that is Inky. It allows you to see how you can expand upon your basic version with a more complex version that did not require you to figure out all of those elements. The thing is, Godot will handle a lot of 
						areas for you that you do not get with Python and you're not jumping straight into full on coding everything that you would with the C# version. So, consider this a step down from C#, but a step up from Python and Inky.
